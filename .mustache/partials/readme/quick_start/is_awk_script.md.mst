Linux based distributions with MAwk, GAwk, and/or Awk installed generally may run Awk scripts directly, eg...


```Bash
script_name.awk --param=value input_file.ext
```


... however, some systems do not have the Awk executable linked to `/usr/bin/awk` file path, in such cases Awk scripts must be invoked via...


```Bash
awk -f script_name.awk --param=value input_file.ext
```
